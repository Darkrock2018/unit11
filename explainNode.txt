Node.js is a framework, used to execute Javascript files through a server. 
This is unlike simply calling up an html file on your PC, in that you do have server-side action/methods available to you.
Node.js is a framework, which means it can process one or various languages in a structure that may have its own syntax, for the benfit
of running a source code in a more efficient way. It is a "single-threaded" framework, meaning it runs and establishes some memory first,
such as variables and functions, and then sets up "listeners" which await the "events" to occur.
Node.js is also know for being asynchronous which means each "event" can be run seperately, whereas some programs await the response/end 
of one process before beginning another. It is argued this framework allows code to be run more quickly because it send small requests one after
another to the CPU without waiting for the response/end of any specific code. Others say it can result in, basically what a back-up of traffic in 
LA can become, block and possibly subsquently crash a program or even the host
